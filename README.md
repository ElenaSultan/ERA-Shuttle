# ERA-Shuttle
The ERA-Shuttle project's GitHub repository is designed to support the achievement of Objectives 1, 3, and 7 by serving as a centralized platform for storing, sharing, and managing project-related data, resources, and documentation. The repository will facilitate collaboration among project partners and streamline data access.

The repository will be organized into several main directories to ensure easy navigation and access to information:

- Equipment_and_Resources

The GitHub repository will be managed with a clear governance structure to ensure data integrity and effective collaboration:

Access Control: 
Different levels of access will be granted based on roles (e.g., read-only, contributor, maintainer).
Collaboration Tools: GitHub issues, pull requests, and project boards will be used for tracking progress, managing tasks, and facilitating discussions.
Regular Updates: The repository will be regularly updated with new data, resources, and documentation to reflect ongoing project activities and results.
By leveraging GitHub's collaborative features, the ERA-Shuttle project aims to enhance the accessibility, integration, and exploitation of research resources, foster cross-sectoral staff exchanges, and raise awareness of the project's impact and results across the European Research Area.
